 * Driver can deletes and update ride offer

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
This describes things needed to install the software.

```bash
- git : to update and clone the repository
- python3: The base language used to develop the api
- pip: a python package used to install project requirements
```

### Installing

```bash
Type: "git clone https://github.com/reiosantos/ride-my-way.git" in your terminal.
```
The UI folder houses the user interface. To access the user interface, open the login.html
file inside the UI/templates folder


The api folder contains the system backend services.

- To install the requirements. run:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements
```

The app can then be run with the following commands.

```bash
cd api

python run.py
```

- Now you can access the system api via URLs:

* To create an account, method[POST]
```http
http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/signup/
```

* To login to an account, method[POST]
```http
http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/login/
```
* To create an account, method[POST]
```http
http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/signup/
```

* To access all rides, method[GET]
```http
http://localhost:5000/apis/v1/rides/
```

* To access a particular ride. ie ride number 5, method[GET]
```http
http://localhost:5000/apis/v1/rides/5/
```

* To delete a particular ride for-example 4, method[DELETE]
```http
http://localhost:5000/apis/v1/rides/4/
```

* To update a particular ride, method[PUT]
```http
http://localhost:5000/api/v1/rides/
```

* To insert a new ride, method[POST]
```http
http://localhost:5000/api/v1/rides/
```

* To send a request to join a particular ride for-example 4, method[POST]
```http
http://localhost:5000/apis/v1/rides/4/request/
```

* To view requests for a particular ride for-example 4, method[GET]
```http
http://localhost:5000/apis/v1/rides/4/request/
```

* To update a request for a ride for-example 4, 
and request number 5 hod[PUT]
```http
http://localhost:5000/apis/v1/rides/4/request/5/
```

* To delete a request of a particular ride 
for-example 4, and ride 5 method[DELETE]
```http
http://localhost:5000/apis/v1/rides/4/request/5/
```
